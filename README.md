# This is a simple scientific Calculator...

A scientific calculator is a type of calculator that is designed to perform advanced mathematical operations, such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponents. It typically has a larger number of buttons and functions than a basic calculator, and is often used by students and professionals in fields such as engineering, physics, and mathematics.

A scientific calculator project typically involves creating a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML provides the structure and layout of the page, the CSS provides the visual styling and design, and the JavaScript provides interactivity and dynamic behavior.

The main features of a scientific calculator include:

    Basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
    Advanced mathematical operations like logarithms, and exponents
    The ability to handle large numbers and decimal places
A clear and easy-to-use interface
